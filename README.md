# Healthcare-Analytics-Dashboard-
✨ Transforming Healthcare Data into Actionable Insights with Power BI
Built an interactive Healthcare Analytics Dashboard to track patient engagement, appointments, and revenue.
This project helped uncover bottlenecks and improve decision-making in healthcare operations.

🔹 Key Highlights:

📅 Weekly & monthly appointment patterns → Identify busiest days & no-show trends.
👥 New vs Returning patients → Patient retention analysis.
💰 Billing & Revenue insights → Compare average billing per patient group.
🩺 Specialization-wise revenue → Understand which treatments drive the most revenue.
👨‍⚕️ Doctor performance → Who contributes more via volume vs value.

🔹 Challenges I Solved:
Handling unbilled patient records (data cleaning).
Creating meaningful KPIs (retention %, avg billing).
Designing tooltips to show deeper insights (e.g., top doctors/day, billing per patient type).

📊 Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling
💡 Outcome: A 2-page report that gives both operational (patient) and financial (billing) insights.
